# üß† CMOS Full Adder (Transistor-Level Design & Simulation)

A 1-bit full adder designed entirely using **CMOS logic** ‚Äî implemented and simulated using **LTSpice** at the transistor level. This project explores how basic digital circuits are built from **PMOS and NMOS transistors** without using predefined logic gates.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I Built

- A complete 1-bit full adder computing:
  - `Sum = A ‚äï B ‚äï Cin`
  - `Carry = AB + Cin(A ‚äï B)`
- XOR, AND, and OR gates built from scratch using CMOS pull-up/pull-down networks
- Simulated using `VPULSE` inputs to cycle all 8 input combinations
- Verified outputs (`Sum` and `Carry`) match theoretical truth table

## üîç Simulation

| A | B | Cin | Sum | Carry |
|---|---|-----|-----|--------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |  0  |   0    |
| 0 | 0 |  1  |  1  |   0    |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |  1  |   0    |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |  0  |   1    |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |  1  |   0    |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |  0  |   1    |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |  0  |   1    |
| 1 | 1 |  1  |  1  |   1    |

üñ•Ô∏è **Tools Used**: LTSpice, basic waveform viewer
